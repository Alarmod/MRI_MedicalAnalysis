	We could redesign the following two classes to mirror the standard better
	by having PDataTF HAVE A list<> of PDVs.  I think we can avoid copying-related
	performance issues if this is THE place where the associated DataSets reside, and
	they are passed to other classes by reference.  After all, I don't see why a
	Command or Data message would ever be changed after it had been received.
