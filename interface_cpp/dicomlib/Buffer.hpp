	//!Buffer for data going between the library and the network.
	/*!
		RATIONALE:
			Because data is send to us across the wire in the form of a series
			of PDVs (See Part 8, Annex E), it doesn't seem to be  practical to read data
			directly from a socket onto a dataset.  An intermediatry 'holding stage' needs
			to be introduced to pull together data from a series of PDVs and make it
			ready to be fed onto a dataset.  (An alternative solution might involve something
			clever with callbacks, but I'm not really sure how.)

			This functionality is provided by the Buffer class.  I haven't spent much time
			fine - tuning this class, I suspect that there is scope for considerable improvement
			in terms of both speed and interface.

		Note that this class also has a responsibility to perform endian corrections as data
		is fed onto and off of it.  (This means that it's duplicating functionality provided
		by class Socket.  Is there a way of abstracting this out into one place?)
			-This abstraction has now mostly been done in socket/SwitchEndian.hpp

		Lots of scope for optimization in this class - in fact, I suspect that
		this is the biggest bottleneck in the library.

		Should look at the interaction between this class and Socket - it might
		be that we CAN do in-place endian switches, because once the data
		has been written to the socket we don't care about it any more, so
		corruption isn't an issue.


		We tried using std::deque to implement this, but took a big performance hit.
		vector is the only guaranteed contiguous container, which means we can
		directly pass data to socket and file functions.
			
			-Trevor

		I do find that we need to support in-place endian swithches. In case of reading
		p_data_tf, there is no way to predict the endian for the data dataset, until we
		check the presentation context id in the pdv item. So, I add a function to set
		the endian in-place.
