	Use this file to specify fixed-length types.
	(Note that c++ defines relationships between type sizes,
	e.g. sizeof(short) <= sizeof(long), but does NOT define
	a byte count for them.  DICOM, however, specifies a fixed
	byte length for it's fundamental types, so we can avoid
	ambiguities by using guaranteed length types like UINT32
	rather than unsigned int.
